### Raw file handling

We understand that raw files are very important for you guys. And they are indeed! They are your negatives, right? That why we decided to let you upload them.

But raw files are also a tricky business. Since it's the sensor information of your DSLR they are fairly complex. Thats why we **do not** read the raw files. In fact we don't even check if the are real raw files. We save then super redundant just like the images files, but you can not generate a jpg out of your raw file with MOLIS. Thats the job of your super sophisticated photo program.

Therefore please note, that you **need to upload a image corresponding to your raw file**. We find this the best way to let us "support" raw files but to not have all the complexity that comes with the raw format.
